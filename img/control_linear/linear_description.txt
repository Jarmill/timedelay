This is the output of optimal control of a linear system

x'(t) = -3x(t) - 5x(t-0.25) + u

The initial history is x(t) = -1 between times [-0.25, 0]

The simulation runs until a terminal time of T = 1

The state cost is J = 0.5 x^2 + 0.5*R*u^2 with R = 0.01
The terminal cost is JT = 0

In open loop, the total cost is 0.0674

The closed loop control allows for u^2 <= 1

At an order 4 relaxation, the control bound is 0.0391

Applying the HJB control yields a total cost of 0.0394

The terminal nonnegativity constraint is 1.6902e-07.

The flow nonneg has a max value of 10^-3, and the other nonneg constraints
have max values of around 10^-5.
